# MovieCategoriser
Instruction:
run MovieSorter.jar
Other files are source files and Furth Instructions on how to use program below

Allows the user to enter movies and their details and display them categorically among other features in order to better keep track of the media consumed. Examples of the data stored are name, length of movie, current watch time (and thus wether it's completed, ongoing or not started) and wether it has been favourited.
 
 
 To Use:  
  Should create a file on desktop called "MediaDatabaseForMediaIsDatabase.txt" when first run  
  You can add Movies (Make sure to add multiple) to this as the program instructs (Name of Movie, length of movie minutes, current time watched in minutes, true/false on wether it should be   favourited.  
  Data will then be added to "MediaDatabaseForMediaIsDatabase.txt"  
  read will allow you to view the name of each movie added according to the order decided  
  Type "o" to change the order of the movies to be displayed in read  
  This can be:  
  Alphabetically and Reverse Alphabetically  
  Longest first and Longest last  
  Favourite first and Favourite last  
  The order can then be viewed with read.  
  
  Specific allows you to view specific information on each Movie entry  
  
  Edit allows you to change the data of the entry (This would generally be favourited and current watch time (as user watches more)).  
  Depending on the watch time of a movie, completition status will be stored as "not started", "currently watching" and "completed".  
  Delete allows a user to delete a Movie entry  
  clearFile will clear the file and remove all the Movie entries  
  Terminante will end the program  
 
 Some validation/ bug testing is shown (mainly in creating a Movie) but the project was made overall by high school java beginners, so we tried our best to learn as much as possible in the short time. Be kind XD
